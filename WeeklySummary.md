Weekly Summary
==============

11/15 - 11/22
-------------
This week, we met intially to discuss high-level goals for our project. First, we discussed our project contract, deciding upon meeting times, how we wanted to split up work, etc. We formally typed this up in our team contract which every member in the group confirmed and agreed to. Next, we focused on our project goals. We decided to use the airport dataset and decided on which traversal method and algorithms we wanted to use. After doing a bit of research about the data set and some possible implementations, we typed up a high level project outline in our project goals document. Then, during the week we started some of the initial set up for our code. Ani created the framework for our graph class which will hold the airport/flight network.
