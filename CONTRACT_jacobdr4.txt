CS 225 - Final Project Team Contract
Tara D’Souza, Anirudh Avadhani, and Jacob Rubin


Communication
1. Team Meetings:
We have decided to meet once a week on Sunday afternoons for 1-2hrs to discuss the work done in the past week and plan ahead for the next week. We will meet over zoom video calls and do written deliverables through google docs. Each week one of us will complete the required one paragraph summary of the week and we will switch off this role very week.


2. Assistance: 
Our team will communicate through our iMessage group chat and when we meet weekly if we have any questions or concerns. We will also make use of comments on google docs and in code files. All of us will respond to each other within a day.


3. Respect: 
When meeting weekly, we will take turns presenting the work we have finished and our questions and concerns. By rotating who is talking everyone will get a chance to present their ideas.


Collaboration
1. Work Distribution: 
At our weekly meeting we will lay out the work we need to complete for the following week and decide how to split up this work. We will strive to split every deliverable three ways equally, but if that is not possible we will adjust workloads accordingly across different deliverables. If someone is overwhelmed with their work or has finished early, we will redistribute work so that all the necessary tasks are completed.


2. Time Commitment: 
Everyone will need to put in around 3-4 hours per week, with higher hours if we fall behind on deliverables. Meetings will be scheduled around conflicts however we will strive to meet originally planned work deadlines as much as possible.


3. Conflict Resolution: 
When we have disagreements or conflicts we will discuss them and resolve them as a group. We will try our best to resolve conflicts by ourselves and involve course staff if absolutely necessary.
